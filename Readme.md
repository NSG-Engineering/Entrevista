# Requirements
A construction firm has asked you to create a Menu for their web application. 

They are very concise and rigorous in what they are requesting. They want a radial menu that shows icons for each of the different links.

## Bare minimum
* It has to be a radial menu
* It has to show icons for each link
* It has to show a textbox with a name for each link when hovering
* All links have to be clickable
## Nice to have
* Animation when opening the menu
* Animation when hovering each link
* Distribution of the links is reactive
    * Eg. If there were just 4 links, you will see each link every 90° (360°/4) instead
* The textbox of each link appears in the left or the right depending in which side is the link
* Background image

# Final comments
> The solution is not tied to an specific language or framework but we should be able to see it in any browser.
> 
> Technically speaking everything can be done with just HTML and CSS.
> 
> Links and Icons can be of the developer taste (free choice).
